# Variance decomposition of climate change mitigation scenarios
## Introduction
This code involves a variance decomposition analysis of climate change mitigation scenarios. The scenario spread of variables such as primary energy carriers, energy use in end-used sectors, emissions and more is attributed to three drivers: (1) climate targets, (2) model differences, and (3) other scenario assumptions.

## Requirements
The code reads in the IPCC AR6 scenario database that is publicly available [here]{https://zenodo.org/record/5886912}.

## Usage
The code requires
